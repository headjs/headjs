<hr />

A small point release that patches a long-standing problem with older IE versions. Browsers that don't support async loading could potentially trigger the callback before the loading of the resources was done.

- Fix: Old IE's can trigger ready too soon
  - This fix was on Github but inclusion got missed
  - [https://github.com/headjs/headjs/issues/203](https://github.com/headjs/headjs/issues/203)

<br /><br /><br />

P.S. The HeadJS site has been revamped to be more dynamic and more easily updateable. However i'm not a designer and as far as typographical choices etc go ..the site could use some Designer Luv !

I'd like to keep the basic layout, but typo, color-scheme, ergonomics, and flat design revamps are very welcome.

If you have some Designer Luv to spread ...bring it on !
