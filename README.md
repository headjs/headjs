##Updates

###0.99 / 2012-11-15

	- Load: Fixed regression in IE6, caused by IE10 fix
	- Load: CSS loading seems to work in all browsers.
		- However a few will not trigger the callback. Over 90% do.
		- For now only load css in situations where you don't need the callback triggered.
		- head.load("file1.css", "file2.css")
	- Load: Conditional loading with head.test() now in evaluation phase
		- try it, but don't rely on it yet
		- head.test(bool, "ok.js", "failed.js", callback)
	- All: CDN is now availiable thanks to: http://cloudflare.com
		- Info in download section on main site
	- Unit Tests
		- Integrated with main site so that everyone can participate
		- They have also been hooked up to automatically report stats back to http://browserscope.org


###v0.98 / 2012-11-09

	- Load: Fixed loading bug in IE10
	- Load: Corrected some issues with loading from inside <head>
	- Load: Rewrite of large parts of code base
	  - Started to massively document the sourcecode :)
	- Load: Test Only (css loading)
	  - You can now load CSS files with head.load("somefile.css")
	  - Consider this as under testing
	  - head.load is an alias to head.js
	- Css3: moved "touch" detection from core to here
	- Css3: added "retina" detection
	- Css3: replaced "font-face" detection that was using "Conditional Comments" with simplisitc browser version detection
	- Core: Added gt, gte, lte, eq classes to width detection (lt existed already)
	- Core: Added gt, gte, lt, lte, eq classes for browser vendor & version detection
	- By default only lt/gt classes are activated
	  - You can of course configure to your likings via head_conf


###RoadMap (v1.0 / v2.0) 2012-11-06

	- Conditional Loader
	  - head.test(bool, success, failure, callback)
	- Resource Loading
	  - head.load(somefile.js , callback)
	  - head.load(somefile.css, callback)
	- Advanced Responsive Design
	  - Take into account browsers min/max versions & height/width pseudo media queries (lt, lte, eq, gt, gte)
	  - .ie-lt6, .ff-gte17, .w-lt1024, .h-gte800
	- Inverse naming conventions for readability & to be able to programatically inject values more easily
	  - .no-box-shadow -> .box-shadow-true/false
		- jQuery(selector).addClass("box-shadow-" + head.features.boxShadow)
		- class="localStorage-<%= bool.toString().toLower() %>"
	  - .no-ie -> .ie-true/false
	  - .index-page -> .page-index
	- Advanced Configuration  
	  - Expose a maximum of functionalty through head_conf, so you only get the functionality you actually require
	    - Enable/Disable lt/gt class generation
	    - Enable/Disable height/width support
   	    - Configure custom height/width/browser breakpoints 
	    - ..etc
	- Remove tests from css3.js and let users "roll their own"
      - 80% of css related tests are probably irrevelant anyways
        - For things like border-radius & the likes everyone uses gracefull degradation with their css anyways ..right ? :)
	- Renaming files
	  - head.responsive.js (can be used standalone)
	    - old core.js with a few additions from css3.js so we can externalise the test suite
	  - head.load.js (can be used standalone)
	    - old load.js
	  - head.features.js (MUST be used with head.responsive.js)
	    - old css3.js, but now only integrates actual tests	  
	- Revamped website with Twitter Bootstrap
	  - Make the site a tad more ergonomic to navigate
	  - Expose unit tests & advanced documentation directly in site
	  - Custom "roll-your-own" builder
	  - Integrate website with gh-pages for quicker deploy
	  
*How much of this roadmap will end up in the current version of head.js, i don't know yet.*

* Most likely when v1.0 comes out, it will have a good part of the above functioanlity included while at the same time preserving the existing api syntax.
  * Like this, those that already depend on HeadJS get no breaking changes.
* At the same time there will probably be a v2.0 release that uses the above syntax, and be the defacto version for future development.
	  
__P.S. 70% of the preliminary work mentioned above is already done :)__
